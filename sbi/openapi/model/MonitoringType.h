 * Possible values are - LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY: The SCS/AS requests to be

 * signalling or user plane communication - UE_REACHABILITY: The SCS/AS requests
 * to be notified when the UE becomes reachable for sending either SMS or
 * downlink data to the UE - LOCATION_REPORTING: The SCS/AS requests to be
 * notified of the current location or the last known location of the UE -
 * CHANGE_OF_IMSI_IMEI_ASSOCIATION: The SCS/AS requests to be notified when the
 * association of an ME (IMEI(SV)) that uses a specific subscription (IMSI) is
 * changed - ROAMING_STATUS: The SCS/AS queries the UE&#39;s current roaming
 * status and requests to get notified when the status changes -
 * COMMUNICATION_FAILURE: The SCS/AS requests to be notified of communication
 * failure events - AVAILABILITY_AFTER_DDN_FAILURE: The SCS/AS requests to be
